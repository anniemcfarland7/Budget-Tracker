# Budget Tracker

## Description 

Budget Tracker is a progressive web application where a user can add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
If a user is travelling, withdrawals and deposits can be tracked with or without a data/internet connection so that the account balance is kept accurate.
